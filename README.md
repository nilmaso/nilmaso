- 👋 Hi, I’m Nil Masó a recently graduated Physicist. I am currently studying a MSc on Biophysics and Complex Systems at Universitat de Barcelona
- 👀 I’m interested in biophysics and the application of microfluidics to research. I'm captivated by the rheological properties of blood and interested in Lab-on-a-chip devices
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Phyton, creating a code to compute the viscosity of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids from data obtained from a microrheometer
